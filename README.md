This is the official implementation of our paper [WL-FPM](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/lpor.202401183), a novel reconstruction routine for Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM). Conventional image-domain optimizations require trade-offs between correction efficacy, data redundancy, and reconstruction accuracy in FPM. Furthermore, the existing linear time-invariant model for actual nonlinear, time-varying optical systems leads to forward model mismatch, complicating the corrections of the vignetting effect. **To overcome these challenges and achieve stitching-free FPM, a family of forward wavelet-transform models (WL-FPM) is proposed.** WL-FPM employs the reversibility of the wavelet transform for high-fidelity reconstruction in the multiscale feature domain. The wavelet loss function is updated in each iteration, and non-convex optimization is solved by complex back diffraction. WL-FPM offers stitching-free, high-resolution, and robust reconstruction under various challenging conditions, including vignetting effects, LED position mismatch, intensity fluctuations, and high-level noise environments. 

## How does it work?
The wavelet-forward FPM is built on our previously developed [ELFPIE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165168423001627), we embed the inverse problem of FPM under the framework of feature extraction/recovering and propose a multiscale wavelet transformation data fidelity. The following picture shows the working pipeline of the Wavelet forward FPM, which has 8 steps. 

<ol>
  <li> Acquire the original images. </li>
  <li> Generate predicted images. </li>
  <li> Evaluate the diï¬€erence between the predicted and original images. </li>
  <li> Decompose multidimensional information using wavelet transform. </li>
  <li> Calculate feature domain errors with a loss function.  </li>
  <li> Learn parameters and gradient information.  </li>
  <li> Implement update iterations. </li>
  <li> Use an optimizer to accelerate the non-convex optimization process. </li>

>MATLAB R2023b and newer. 

### Codes
>**USAF resolution testing target**
>Experimental results for the USAF target are available in the folder [USAF](https://github.com/ShuheZhang-MUMC/Wavelet-Forward-FPM/tree/main/Demos/USAF). <br>
>These images were collected when illuminated by white light LEDs, so there is very low coherence. A total of 225 images were collected. 

>**Fish gill sample**
>Experimental results for Fish gill are available in the folder [fish](https://github.com/ShuheZhang-MUMC/Wavelet-Forward-FPM/tree/main/Demos/fish_samples)
>These images were collected by RGB images, sequentially. The LED panel is a circular shape. A total of 93 images were collected.

## Overview

### Large aberration correction
The WL-FPM recovers large aberrations without prior knowledge of the aberrations.

### Wavelet Bases
In WL-FPM, diï¬€erent wavelet bases and decomposition lay-ers are used to obtain various frequency information. Diï¬€erent wavelet bases have distinct mathematical properties, such as size of support, vanishing moments, and symmetry. 
The following image shows the use of different wavelet bases and decomposition levels and the impacts on reconstructions.
